# Project: Book to Movie  
## Team Members: Marni Hager, Pedro Perez, Sergii Otryshko  

This project will check if a movie is based on a book and return the book title and author.  It will utilize IMDB API to obtain the information and then display the movie poster and, if available, the book cover.  The project will also utilize Auth0 and MongoDb to allow a user to access only the movies they've searched for.  The front end will be deployed via Netlify, the back end will be deployed via Heroku.  Finally, a form will be available that allows a user to udpate certain warnings of the movie (i.e., language, nudity, etc.) and a free form field for any additional notes.
