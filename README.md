## Conflict Plan
1. Discuss conflict in a civilized manner.  Objective is to make sure that we understand the root of the conflict.
2. If two out of three agreed on conflict resolution, then conflict is resolved.
3. If each team member has a different opinion about the resolution or a situation arises that is not solvable among team members, then the team will get a mediator.
4. If one person takes over the project, it is the responsibility of the other two team members to follow the conflict plan and address the situation. 
5. As team members we will leverage each others strengths,while balancing what we want to get out of the project and completing the work on a timely manner.
6. In cases where we have knowledge gaps and not enough time to learn, we will together decide the balance between learning and coding.
7. If a member is not adequately contributing, the other team members will have a respectful conversation to understand the situation and asked for a change in output.
8. If point 1 and 2 ofconflict plan fails, then team will escalate conflict to mediator.

## Communication Plan
Team will be fully available at class time.  In addition, team will also meet at pre-arrange hours.  The team will agree together on additional hours. The forms of communication includes email and Remo. We will take breaks as often as needed. If we start to fall behind the team will re-prioritize and split tasks.  The assignment of tasks may be based on individual stregths. The practice of open and mutual respect at all conversations will ensure that all voices are heard.
